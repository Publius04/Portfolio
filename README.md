# PortfolioProjects

Below, I've included summaries for each project.

## shopping_stock_checker

This project was completed for a client who wanted to be notified via text when a product became available for purchase. The included code scraped website data for product availability and notified the client's personal phone via sms messaging.

## ai_audio_summary

One of ChatGPT's most helpful features is to distil large amounts of information into digestible, readable text. However, ChatGPT does not yet have the ability to summarize information that does not already exist as text. This project automates several ai tools to generate summary texts of either youtube videos or audio files. 

## check_homework_assignments

While I was still in highschool, my classmates and I didn't like our school's clunky and inaccessible website. This webscraper automates a login, and scraping of assignment data.

## generate_citation

In highschool, I was part of a speech and debate club. Many websites exist to generate citations, but for our debate league, we were required to write citations in a specific, technical format. This project automatically created citations by utilizing a docker dataserver called zotero which had access to relevant citation information from many news sources and blogs.

## rss_feed_email

This project scrapes data from the rss feeds of different news sources and formats collected information into an email using the MIME protocol. I still use this code as a quick and efficient way to stay current with the news.

## spotify_liked_songs_playlist

At the time of coding this project, it was not possible for a Spotify user to share their like songs with others. It was only possible to share playlists that had their own unique playlist_id. This project generates a playlist from a user's liked songs using the Spotify API service.
