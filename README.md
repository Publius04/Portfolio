# Portfolio

Below are summaries of each folder.

## Automation

This folder contains a number of practical python automations and webscraping projects.

### 1. Vocab

This simple webscraping automation compiles vocabulary data scraped from the internet and compiles to more useable and readable formats.

### 2. Stock Checker

This project was completed for a client who wanted to be notified via text when a product became available for purchase. The included code scraped website data for product availability and notified the client's personal phone via sms messaging.

### 3. AI Audio Summary

One of ChatGPT's most helpful features is to distil large amounts of information into digestible, readable text. However, ChatGPT does not yet have the ability to summarize information that does not already exist as text. This project automates several ai tools to generate summary texts of either youtube videos or audio files. 

### 4. Codecademy CLI

A cli for interacting with Codecademy programming "cheatsheets" for easy access.

### 5. Assignment Scraper

While I was in highschool, my classmates and I didn't like our school's slow, clunky website. This webscraper automates a login, and scraping of assignment data.

### 6. Citation Generator

In highschool, I was part of a speech and debate club. Many websites exist to generate citations, but for our debate league, we were required to write citations in a specific, technical format. This project automatically created citations by utilizing a docker dataserver called zotero which had access to relevant citation information from many news sources and blogs.

### 7. RSS Feed to Email

This project scrapes data from the rss feeds of different news sources and formats collected information into an email using the MIME protocol. I still use this code as a quick and efficient way to stay informed on current events.

### 8. Spotify Playlist Automation

At the time of coding this project, it was not possible for a Spotify user to share their like songs with others. It was only possible to share playlists that had their own unique playlist_id. This project generates a playlist from a user's liked songs using the Spotify API service.

## Chemistry

My highschool chemistry teacher would often assign long, tedious problem sets. I created a number of automations for automating my chemistry homework, from automating simple data pulls for chemical compounds to automating the steps of balancing equations and writing lab reports.

## CP

A number of data structures and algorithms (dsa) programs.

## Cryptography

Several simple/historical ciphers for encrypting strings of alphabetic characters and methods of attack against these ciphers (shift cipher, affine cipher, vergenere cipher, hill/block cipher).

## Data Science

An analysis of CDC Covid data using the basic data analysis paradigm: data collection, data cleaning, data analysis, and data interpretation/visualization. 

## Math

A few programs used for mathematical modeling, including models for differentical equations, graphical representations of logistic maps and a parabolic spiral.

## Trading

A simple algorithmic trading strategy for cryptocurrency on the phemex exchange using technical analysis indicators to generate buy and sell signals.
